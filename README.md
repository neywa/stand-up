stand-up is a small application that displays a timer counting one hour and notifying the user to stand up (or sit down) when working at computer for longer time. The idea is to make regular use of a standing desk. Initial interval for stand up/sit down is 1 hour.

TODO:
- make the Reset button work
- pressing the timer button restarts the function but do not abort the actual function run
- there is an 8 second delay between the function end and starts
